# some_of_statistics
These are solutions to selected exercises from Wasserman's mathematical statistics book "All of Statistics" (first edition). It is partially to guide my own learning process in statistics. There are folders for different chapters of the book. Each folder contains a pdf of problem statements and solutions along with some Jupyter notebooks for solving the more computational problems in a given chapter. The Jupyter notebooks are linked to in the solutions pdf.

There is another Github repo with a more complete set of solutions that you may want to consult: https://github.com/telmo-correa/all-of-statistics/

Any comments, questions, corrections, etc. are happily welcomed.
